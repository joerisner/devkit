# devkit

CLI tool providing convenience scripts for my local development.

## Getting started

This project uses `uv` for managing Python versions, dependencies, and the project's environment. Run the `setup` target to get started with `uv`.

```sh
make setup
```

Build the package.

```sh
make build
```

See additional `make` targets by viewing the [Makefile](./Makefile) or by running `make help` (or just `make`).
